Stream types 

The following main Stream types are defined: 

Forces - such as transferred by a bracket, bolts, flanges, etc. 

Information - such as exchanged with a control system, sensor, etc. 

Energy (power) - see subdivision below 

Material flow - see subdivision below 

Of these Stream types the following two are subdivided: 

Energy (power) 

Electric - such as power from supply and to a motor 

Thermal - such as cooling or heating 

Solar - such as PV panels 

Mechanical - such as a motor drive shaft 

Sound (noise) - such as noise emitted from a machinery 

Wind - such as that acting on wind turbine blades 

Hydropower - such as that acting on a water turbine 

Material flow 

Fluid (liquid) - such as water, oil, chemical fluids, low gas ratio multiphase fluids 

Gas - such as methane, air, nitrogen, high gas ratio multiphase fluids 

Dry granulated - such as sand, powder 

Solid pieces - such as bricks, boxes, pieces

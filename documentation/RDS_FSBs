Functional System Block types 

The following Functional System Block types are defined:  

Functional System Blocks providing a Stream 

Convert one type of Stream to another type of Stream (Example of products used to fulfil the function are Motors, Turbines) 

Dividing one Stream into several of the same kind of Stream (Example of products used to fulfil the function are Separators, Centrifuges) 

Functional System Block transporting a Stream 

Transporting or moving one Stream from one point to another (Example of products used to fulfil the function are pipes, cables) 

Storage of a Stream (Example of products used to fulfil the function are tanks, caverns) 

Functional System Block Receiving a Stream 

Collecting several Streams of the same kind into fewer Streams of the same kind (Example of products used to fulfil the function are manifolds, cable terminals, radio receiver) 

Functional System Block Controlling a Stream 

Controlling a Stream of the same kind by means of controlling the Stream rate (Example of product is a switch, regulator, control valve, isolation valve) 

Functional System Block Blocking a Stream 

Blocking a Stream of the same kind by means of obstructing the Stream  

(Example of product is a blind flange, an enclosure, insulation)

# Assumptions
* We will not support automatic layout, i.e. all object placement on a canvas is done by an end user
* Initial versions will be using React only
* Initial versions will only support basic graphical customization, future versions may need to support more specialyzed drawing features (vector graphics, position of connectors etc)
* JSON LD format will be used as contract for the API
